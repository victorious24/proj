    	<h1>WO2016102686A1</h2>
    		<h2> underwater car</h2>
    		<p> An underwater vehicle comprising a structure (11) holding six thrusters (12) each defining a thrust vector. The thrust vector of each of the six thrusters (12) is oriented as follows: a first thrust vector and a second thrust vector are disposed on respective first and second planes, said first and second planes being parallel to each other; a third thrust vector and a fourth thrust vector are disposed on respective third and fourth planes, said third and fourth planes being parallel to each other and perpendicular to said first and second planes; and a fifth thrust vector and a sixth thrust vector are disposed on respective fifth and sixth planes, said fifth and sixth planes being parallel to each other and perpendicular to said first, second, third and fourth planes, such that the vehicle is enabled to move in a controlled way along its 6 spatial degrees-of- freedom. A system comprising an underwater vehicle and a control center from which the vehicle is controlled. </p>
    		<h3> TECHNICAL FIELD </h3>
    		<p>The present invention relates to the field of underwater vehicles, and in particular to those vehicles often used for subsea tasks, such as inspecting, cleaning or repairing equipment located underwater.</p>
    		<p>An underwater vehicle is described. The underwater vehicle can be a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV). ROVs are controlled by a person from a remote location, such as a boat connected to the ROV via an umbilical. Alternatively, the umbilical is connected from the ROV to an unmanned boat or platform, which is wirelessly connected to a control center. The umbilical provides power to the ROV and transmits/receives data between the ROV and the manned control center. It is possible to remove the umbilical from the ROV, in which case the vehicle is powered by means of batteries. Moreover, the vehicle may be programmed for developing a mission in an autonomous way. These vehicles are called AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles) when they always work autonomously (they need no remote operation at all) and hybrid ROVs (HROVs) when they can either be remotely controlled via an umbilical or be autonomous, for which the umbilical is removed. This invention applies to ROVs, AUVs and HROVs.</p>
